This directory contains scripts for CI builds on travis-ci.org

## Vagrant

If you have vagrant and virtualbox installed, you can test the scripts in a local VM.


Use `vagrant up` to start a vm, `vagrant destroy -f` to stop and delete it.
Enter the VM with `vagrant ssh` press `ctrl-d` or type `exit` to leave the VM session.


You can run the script with `/vagrant/build-test.sh`
